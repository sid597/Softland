# Plan

<!-- Phase 1 Step 5. Fill in after completing Steps 1-4. After completing this, fill in PLAN_VALIDATION.md. -->

## Reads
<!-- For each read operation: access method, path expression, partition -->

## Writes
<!-- For each write operation: depot, event type -->

## PState Design
<!-- For each PState:
If obvious: why this is the only reasonable design
If not obvious:
  Option A: schema — query cost: N seeks, M iterations because why
  Option B: schema — query cost: N seeks, M iterations because why
  Chosen: A or B because why -->

## Depots
<!-- - *name: (hash-by :key), event types [...] -->

## Topologies and PStates
<!-- Each topology owns zero or more PStates. Only the owning topology can write to a PState.
A module can have multiple topologies of different types.

TOPOLOGY TYPE RULES:
- Default is microbatch. Every topology is microbatch unless one of these forces stream:
  (a) millisecond-level update latency — the caller needs PState changes visible immediately
  (b) ack coordination — the caller needs to block or receive a return value via the depot append
- A single user-facing operation often has multiple processing concerns with different latency
  requirements. Split them by type — the latency-sensitive part belongs in the stream topology,
  everything else in the microbatch topology. Multiple topologies can consume the same depot
  independently, or the stream topology can communicate to the microbatch topology with an
  internal depot.

TOPOLOGY COUNT RULES:
- Extending an existing module: add to the topologies it already has. Do NOT add a topology
  per feature, per subsystem, or per build stage. A new topology permanently partitions PState
  write access and cannot be undone without a migration.
- Declare a topology only when work requires it. A module with no ETL — mirrors plus query
  topologies — has none at all.
- At most ONE stream topology. Stream topologies all share one performance profile — an event
  takes a few milliseconds end to end — so a split isolates nothing and only costs write access:
  a PState is declared on one topology and only that topology can write it, so a later feature
  needing to write an existing PState from a new event cannot. If you declare a second, state
  what forces it.
- Split microbatch topologies ONLY with arithmetic: state each concern's iteration time and show
  they differ by an order of magnitude. A microbatch cycle is as slow as the slowest work in it,
  so a 0.5s computation colocated with a 5s one takes 5s. Feature boundaries and differing "feel"
  are NOT reasons — nearly all derived-view work is in one latency class.

For each topology, list:
- topology-name: microbatch | stream
- Why this type: cite which stream reason applies, or state "default microbatch"
- For each processing concern in the topology: does it actually require this topology type?
  If any concern does not need the topology's stream/latency guarantees, it belongs in a
  separate microbatch topology.
- If stream: list each write and whether it is idempotent or non-idempotent.
    Non-idempotent writes in stream topologies will duplicate on retry.
    Move non-idempotent writes to microbatch, make them idempotent, or explain the dedup mechanism.
  PStates:
    - $$name: full typed schema — no Object anywhere -->

## Query Topologies
<!-- - name:
  Input example 1: describe input → N total reads, M meaningful (non-empty) reads
  Input example 2: different input → N total reads, M meaningful (non-empty) reads
  Fixed or variable: fixed if M is same for all inputs, variable if M differs
  If variable, dynamic approach: ops/explode + aggregator | loop<- | etc. -->

## Partitioning efficiency
<!-- FIRST derive the optimal placement, THEN derive the partitioners from it, THEN validate with the table.

**Optimal placement (do this first, before choosing any partitioner).** State the placement the dominant read wants: for each key, the set of task(s) its data should live on — `f(key) → task(s)` — that minimizes total seeks for that read while keeping aggregate load balanced across tasks. THEN derive the partitioner(s) that implement that `f`: `|hash` = `hash(k) mod N`, `|all` = every task, `|direct` = any `f` you compute or store (see `pstate-schema.md` "Partitioning control"). Do NOT start from a partitioner and ask "is it good enough" — start from `f` and implement it.

**Validate with the table.** For the dominant read operation, build the table below at THREE cluster sizes: N = 1, N = 16, and N = 128 tasks. N = 1 is the single-task baseline (all data on one task).

Rows are DATA CATEGORIES — categorizer the data by each input regime, so the table includes all kinds of data, both common and infrequent. "Frequency proportion" is the fraction of operations that hit that category; proportions MUST sum to 1. "Seeks/op" is the **total number of tasks the operation reads from**, summed across the whole cluster — one local read (seek) per task touched. A read that fans to all N tasks costs **N**, even if some tasks' local slice is empty (the read is still dispatched there). This is a TOTAL across tasks — do NOT count per-task or divide by the task count (a per-task number falls as N grows for any design and measures nothing). "Iterator reads/op" is likewise the total elements iterated across all tasks.

Fill the table for each N and compute the two weighted sums:
  Weighted seeks          = Σ(proportion × seeks/op)
  Weighted iterator reads = Σ(proportion × iterator-reads/op)

### N = 1 task (single-task baseline)
| Data category | Frequency proportion | Seeks/op | Iterator reads/op |
|---|---|---|---|
| <input category 1>  | <0–1> | <#> | <#> |
| <input category 2>  | <0–1> | <#> | <#> |
Weighted seeks = <#>   |   Weighted iterator reads = <#>

### N = 16 tasks
| Data category | Frequency proportion | Seeks/op | Iterator reads/op |
|---|---|---|---|
| <input category 1>  | <0–1> | <#> | <#> |
| <input category 2>  | <0–1> | <#> | <#> |
Weighted seeks = <#>   |   Weighted iterator reads = <#>

### N = 128 tasks
| Data category | Frequency proportion | Seeks/op | Iterator reads/op |
|---|---|---|---|
| <input category 1>  | <0–1> | <#> | <#> |
| <input category 2>  | <0–1> | <#> | <#> |
Weighted seeks = <#>   |   Weighted iterator reads = <#>

If weighted seeks grow substantially from N=1 to N=128, the partitioning is INEFFICIENT — redesign (consider creative `|direct` placement). A good design keeps weighted seeks roughly flat as N grows. -->

## Design Decisions
<!-- - Subindexing: which PState collections are subindexed and why
- Colocation: how depot partitioning aligns with PState keys -->

## State primitive selection
<!-- For every piece of state in the design, name the storage class and justify:
- $$name (PState): per-source-event write volume O(?) in <bounded inputs>. Durable.
- *cache (TaskGlobal): non-durable. Rebuild by reading from PState on each cache miss. Cite the code that does it.
- external: <name>  -->

## Resource usage analysis
<!-- For each storage location (PState, TaskGlobal), estimate the resource footprint per task under load. The goal is to minimize memory and disk usage while staying within latency constraints.

### Disk usage (PStates)
For each PState and depot, estimate bytes per entry and total size per task:
- Entry size: key size + value size (include all fields, nested structures, index overhead for subindexed structures)
- Growth rate: how many entries per unit time
- Total per task: entries × entry size / number of tasks

### Memory usage (TaskGlobals)
For each TaskGlobal, estimate:
- Entry size in bytes: count every field stored per entry. Use primitives (long, int) instead of boxed objects (Long, Integer) where possible.
- Entries per task: worst-case count
- Total memory per task: entries × entry size
- GC pressure: large object graphs with many small maps/vectors create GC overhead. Flat structures, primitive arrays, or compact representations MUST be used when possible since GC causes long pauses which degrade latency-sensitive operations like foreign reads.

### Minimization
For each storage location, state whether the current design is minimal or whether data could be reduced:
- Can any of the data in the cache be fetched from a PState at query time instead of cached in memory without violating latency requirements?
- Can fields be stored as primitives instead of objects?
- Can per-entry overhead be reduced by using arrays or packed representations instead of maps?
- Does the design duplicate data across storage locations? If so, justify why (latency constraint) or eliminate. -->

## Design difficulty log
<!-- An honest, first-person record of where this design was hard to settle. Write it as you design, not as a summary. For each decision that was genuinely contested:
- The decision (which PState schema, partitioning, placement, or topology).
- The competing approach(es) you weighed, and how close the call was — was an alternative genuinely competitive, or was the choice forced once you costed it against the requirements?
- What finally settled it.
If nothing was contested — every choice was forced once the requirements were read — say so plainly and briefly. Do not manufacture difficulty; do not hide it. -->
