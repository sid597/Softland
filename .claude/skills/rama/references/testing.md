# Rama Module Testing

Test Rama modules end-to-end using `InProcessCluster`, which
simulates a full cluster in a single process with no mocks required.

## Test Structure

**Minimize IPC and module launches.** Each `create-ipc` + `launch-module!` is expensive — it starts a full cluster simulation that can take 30s to complete launching. Do NOT create a separate IPC/module per assertion or per scenario. Test scenarios that use disjoint keys do not interfere and belong in the same `with-open` block, even if they exercise different operations. Use one `with-open` block covering multiple `testing` sections that share the same module instance:

```clojure
(deftest module-test
  (with-open [ipc (rtest/create-ipc)]
    (rtest/launch-module! ipc MyModule {:tasks (rand-nth [2 4 8]) :threads 2 :workers 2})
    (let [module-name (get-module-name MyModule)
          depot (foreign-depot ipc module-name "*depot")
          pstate (foreign-pstate ipc module-name "$$pstate")]

      (testing "basic writes and reads"
        (foreign-append! depot ...)
        (rtest/wait-for-microbatch-processed-count ipc module-name "topo" 1)
        (is (= expected (foreign-select-one ...))))

      (testing "edge cases"
        ...)

      (testing "error handling"
        ...))))
```

**Write fewer test functions with more assertions.** Each test function that launches a module adds seconds of startup time. Group related assertions into `testing` blocks within the same test function. One well-structured test with 20 assertions is better than 10 tests with 2 assertions each.

**Randomize task count.** Unless a test requires a specific number of tasks, use a random task count (e.g., `(rand-nth [2 4 8])`) to exercise partitioning logic across different configurations. Partition alignment bugs often only surface with certain task counts.

## Axioms

1. **IPC = real cluster** — no capability or semantic differences; only replication factor (always 1) and serialization scope differ
2. **ACK blocks downstream** — acked depot appends block until all downstream processing on colocated stream topologies complete; assertions are immediate
3. **ACK does not cross module boundaries** — mirror depot stream topologies in other modules are not waited on; polling required
4. **Microbatch count is cumulative** — `wait-for-microbatch-processed-count` tracks total records ever processed, not since last call
5. **Pause completes in-flight** — `pause-microbatch-topology!` waits for the current microbatch to finish before returning
6. **Deletion is explicit** — removing PStates/depots on update requires `objects-to-delete`; omission throws
7. **Serialization only crosses workers** — custom serializations only exercise between workers, not within; use `:workers > 1` to test them
8. **test-pstate is module-free** — `create-test-pstate` tests PState operations and `deframafn`/`deframaop` without launching a module
9. **Hashing is deterministic** — `gen-hashing-index-keys` always produces the same keys for the same inputs

## Setup

```clojure
(ns my.module-test
  (:require
    [com.rpl.rama :refer :all]
    [com.rpl.rama.path :refer :all]
    [com.rpl.rama.test :as rtest]
    [clojure.test :refer [deftest is testing]]))
```

## InProcessCluster

Create with `rtest/create-ipc`. Always use `with-open` for cleanup.

```clojure
(with-open [ipc (rtest/create-ipc)]
  (rtest/launch-module! ipc MyModule {:tasks 4 :threads 2})
  (let [module-name (get-module-name MyModule)
        depot       (foreign-depot ipc module-name "*depot")
        counts      (foreign-pstate ipc module-name "$$counts")]
    (foreign-append! depot "a")
    (foreign-append! depot "a")
    (is (= 2 (foreign-select-one (keypath "a") counts)))))
```

### LaunchConfig Options

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `:tasks` | Number of task partitions |
| `:threads` | Number of task threads per worker |
| `:workers` | Number of workers (default 1) |

Multiple workers exercise custom serializations (Rama only serializes
between workers). Replication factor is always 1 on InProcessCluster.

### Custom Serializations

```clojure
(with-open [ipc (rtest/create-ipc [MyCustomSerialization])]
  ...)
```

## Testing Stream Topologies

With colocated stream topologies, depot appends using `AckLevel/ACK`
(the default) block until all downstream processing finishes. Assert
on PStates immediately after appends.

```clojure
(foreign-append! depot "x")
(foreign-append! depot "x")
(is (= 2 (foreign-select-one (keypath "x") counts)))
```

## Testing Microbatch Topologies

Microbatch processing is asynchronous to depot appends. Use
`wait-for-microbatch-processed-count` to block until processing
completes. Accepts an optional `timeout-millis` (throws on timeout).

```clojure
(foreign-append! depot "a")
(foreign-append! depot "b")
(foreign-append! depot "a")
(rtest/wait-for-microbatch-processed-count ipc module-name "counter" 3)
(is (= 2 (foreign-select-one (keypath "a") counts)))

(foreign-append! depot "a")
(rtest/wait-for-microbatch-processed-count ipc module-name "counter" 4)
(is (= 3 (foreign-select-one (keypath "a") counts)))
```

The count is the **total** records ever processed by the topology,
not since the last call.

### Controlling Microbatch Composition

Use pause/resume to guarantee which records appear in a single
microbatch (useful for testing batch blocks):

```clojure
(rtest/pause-microbatch-topology! ipc module-name "counter")
(foreign-append! depot "a")
(foreign-append! depot "b")
(foreign-append! depot "c")
(rtest/resume-microbatch-topology! ipc module-name "counter")
```

`pause-microbatch-topology!` waits for the in-flight microbatch to
complete before returning (no-op if already paused). The next
microbatch contains all records appended while paused (up to 1000 per
partition). `resume-microbatch-topology!` is a no-op if already active.

## Testing Stream Topologies with Mirror Depots

Depot appends with `AckLevel/ACK` do **not** wait for stream
topologies in other modules to finish. Poll the PState with a
timeout:

```clojure
(defn assert-value-attained
  "Polls f until (= expected (f)), with timeout-ms (default 30s)."
  ([expected f] (assert-value-attained expected f 30000))
  ([expected f timeout-ms]
   (let [deadline (+ (System/currentTimeMillis) timeout-ms)]
     (loop []
       (let [v (f)]
         (cond
           (= expected v) true
           (> (System/currentTimeMillis) deadline)
           (throw (ex-info "Timed out" {:expected expected :actual v}))
           :else (do (Thread/sleep 50) (recur))))))))

;; Usage
(with-open [ipc (rtest/create-ipc)]
  (rtest/launch-module! ipc DepotModule {:tasks 8 :threads 2})
  (rtest/launch-module! ipc CounterModule {:tasks 4 :threads 2})
  (let [depot  (foreign-depot ipc (get-module-name DepotModule) "*depot")
        counts (foreign-pstate ipc (get-module-name CounterModule) "$$counts")]
    (foreign-append! depot "a")
    (foreign-append! depot "a")
    (assert-value-attained 2 #(foreign-select-one (keypath "a") counts))))
```

Use a generous timeout (30s) to avoid false failures from GC pauses.

## Module Update

Test module evolution by overriding `getModuleName` so both versions
share the same module name:

```clojure
(with-open [ipc (rtest/create-ipc)]
  (rtest/launch-module! ipc ModuleV1 {:tasks 4 :threads 2})
  (let [module-name (get-module-name ModuleV1)
        depot  (foreign-depot ipc module-name "*depot")
        counts (foreign-pstate ipc module-name "$$counts")]
    (foreign-append! depot "a")
    (is (= 2 (foreign-select-one (keypath "a") counts)))

    (rtest/update-module! ipc ModuleV2)
    (foreign-append! depot "a")
    (is (= 3 (foreign-select-one (keypath "a") counts)))))
```

Existing depot and PState clients automatically redirect to the
updated module instance.

### Removing PStates or Depots on Update

When the new version removes PStates or depots, specify them
explicitly:

```clojure
(rtest/update-module! ipc ModuleV2
  {:objects-to-delete ["*depot2" "$$old-pstate"]})
```

The deleted objects must be specified exactly or the update throws.

## Module Destroy

```clojure
(rtest/destroy-module! ipc "com.mycompany.MyModule")
```

Fails if other modules depend on the module being destroyed.

## Circular Dependencies

Create mutual module dependencies through sequential updates:

1. Launch Module A (with depot only)
2. Launch Module B (mirrors Module A's depot)
3. Update Module A to add dependency on Module B's PState

Override `getModuleName` on Module A's versions to keep the same
module name across updates.

## create-test-pstate

Test PState operations and `deframafn`/`deframaop` without launching
a module. Use `with-open` for cleanup.

```clojure
(with-open [tp (rtest/create-test-pstate
                 {String (map-schema Long String {:subindex? true})})]
  (rtest/test-pstate-transform [(keypath "k" 1) (termval "v")] tp)
  (is (= "v" (rtest/test-pstate-select-one [(keypath "k" 1)] tp))))
```

### Testing a deframafn

```clojure
(deframafn inc-counter [$$p k]
  (local-transform> [(keypath k) (term inc)] $$p)
  (:>))

(with-open [tp (rtest/create-test-pstate {String Long})]
  (rtest/test-pstate-transform [(keypath "a") (termval 10)] tp)
  (inc-counter tp "a")
  (is (= 11 (rtest/test-pstate-select-one [(keypath "a")] tp))))
```

Works identically for `deframaop` — pass the test PState where the
operation expects a `$$pstate` argument.

## gen-hashing-index-keys

Generate keys that hash to specific task partitions, useful for
testing partition-dependent logic:

```clojure
;; Returns a seq where nth element hashes to task n
(rtest/gen-hashing-index-keys 4)
;; With prefix
(rtest/gen-hashing-index-keys "user-" 4)
```

Deterministic — always produces the same keys for the same inputs.

## Simulated Time

Modules that check the current time should use `TopologyUtils/currentTimeMillis` instead of `System/currentTimeMillis`. In production this returns real time. In tests, you can control it:

```clojure
(:import [com.rpl.rama.helpers TopologyUtils])

(with-open [_sim (TopologyUtils/startSimTime)]
  ;; Sim time starts at 0
  (TopologyUtils/advanceSimTime 60000) ;; now at 60000ms
  ;; Module code calling TopologyUtils/currentTimeMillis sees 60000
  (TopologyUtils/advanceSimTime 30000) ;; now at 90000ms
  )
;; After close, currentTimeMillis returns real system time again
```

`startSimTime` uses global state — call `.close` on the returned `Closeable` before exiting the test. Use `with-open` for automatic cleanup.

## Testing Tick Depots

Tick depots fire automatically on a timer, which makes testing non-deterministic. To control when ticks fire in tests, replace the tick depot with a regular global depot that tests can append to manually.

Define a global var somewhere in the project that tests can redef:

```clojure
(def REPLACE-TICK-DEPOTS false)

(defmodule MyModule [setup topologies]
  (if REPLACE-TICK-DEPOTS
    (declare-depot setup *expire-tick :random {:global? true})
    (declare-tick-depot setup *expire-tick 30000))
  ...)
```

Tests set this flag with `with-redefs` before creating the module:

```clojure
(with-redefs [my.config/REPLACE-TICK-DEPOTS true]
  (with-open [_sim (TopologyUtils/startSimTime)]
    ;; Launch module — tick depot is now a regular depot
    ;; Advance sim time, then append to tick depot to trigger processing
    (TopologyUtils/advanceSimTime 60000)
    (foreign-append! tick-depot nil)
    (rtest/wait-for-microbatch-processed-count ipc module-name "topo" 1)))
```
