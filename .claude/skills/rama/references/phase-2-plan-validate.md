# Phase 2: Plan Validation

Adversarially validate `PLAN.md` against the spec. Produce `PLAN_VALIDATION.md` with a verdict.

**You are an adversarial reviewer. The default verdict is FAIL.** PASS only after explicit scenario-tracing for every constraint shows no violations. The plan you are reviewing was written by someone with a stake in shipping it; your job is to find every way it does not satisfy the spec.

## Inputs

- The user-facing spec (read it now, even if you read it earlier)
- `<impl-root>/IMPLICIT_SPEC.md`
- `<impl-root>/PLAN.md`
- This skill

## Steps

1. Copy the validation template if it doesn't already exist:
   ```bash
   cp <skill-root>/references/artifact-plan-validation.md <impl-root>/PLAN_VALIDATION.md
   ```
2. Read the spec in full. Re-read every constraint, prohibition, and performance requirement. Do not paraphrase — quote the exact wording when checking compliance.
3. Read `PLAN.md` in full.
4. Read `references/artifact-plan-validation.md` — the template lists the categories of checks to perform.
5. Walk every check item. **Do not tick PASS until you have done explicit scenario-tracing.** For each constraint in the spec:
   - State the constraint verbatim.
   - Walk through a concrete scenario that exercises it (specific values, specific entity counts, specific timing).
   - Cite the line(s) in `PLAN.md` that handle this scenario.
   - State whether the cited mechanism actually handles it. Do NOT accept "the plan addresses this" without a citation.
6. **Self-consistency check.** Re-read your own validation entries. If anywhere in this artifact you wrote that something is "a gap" or "doesn't fully solve" or "not ideal" or "this is a tradeoff," that's a FAIL on the corresponding check. Do not pass and contradict yourself in the same artifact.
7. Fill in `PLAN_VALIDATION.md` with the results. For each check, state pass or fail with cited evidence.

## Output

`<impl-root>/PLAN_VALIDATION.md`, fully filled in.

## Verdict

Emit either `PHASE_VALIDATION:pass` or `PHASE_VALIDATION:fail` as the last non-empty line of your output. Default to FAIL.

If any check is FAIL: report FAIL, with each failure explicitly listing the spec line, the plan line, and why the plan does not satisfy the spec. The retry phase will read this artifact and revise the plan.

If every check passes after honest scenario-tracing: report PASS.

## Do NOT

- Do NOT default to PASS. The default is FAIL.
- Do NOT paraphrase a constraint to make the plan satisfy it. Quote the spec verbatim and check the plan against the verbatim text.
- Do NOT certify any check whose body says "this is a gap" or equivalent. Those are FAILs.
- Do NOT skip scenario-tracing. "The plan addresses constraint X" is not evidence — a citation to specific lines that handle a specific scenario is.
