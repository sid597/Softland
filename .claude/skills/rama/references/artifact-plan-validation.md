# Plan Validation

<!-- Phase 1 Step 6. Fill in after PLAN.md is complete. After all items pass, write the file skeleton (Step 7), then implement topologies (Phase 2), then foreign client (Phase 3), then fill in IMPLEMENTATION_VALIDATION.md (Phase 4). -->

Read `PLAN.md` first, then fill in each item below. Extract the relevant data from the plan and state pass or fail with evidence. If any item fails, fix `PLAN.md` and re-validate.

## Query topology: <name>
- Input examples present: <yes/no>
- Example 1: N=<total reads>, M=<meaningful reads>. N == M? <yes/no>
- Example 2: N=<total reads>, M=<meaningful reads>. N == M? <yes/no>
- If any N > M: FAIL — query issues wasted reads. Fix the plan.
- M values across examples: <list>. All same? <yes/no>
- If M differs: must be marked variable with dynamic approach. Is it? <yes/no>

## PState schemas
- Group the plan's PStates by (key type, partitioner). For each group of two or more, name them and state why they are not one PState whose value is a fixed-keys-schema with a field per piece of data. Only a difference in key structure or partitioner justifies the split — "different concerns", "different subsystems", "different lifecycles", or "clearer separation" do NOT. <list each group and its justification — if any group of two or more PStates shares a key type and partitioner without such a justification, FAIL: every PState partition carries its own memory overhead on every task>
- Any Object type? <yes/no — if yes, FAIL>
- Uniform record-like values (all instances have same fields) use fixed-keys-schema? <yes/no – if no, FAIL>
- If different instances at the same PState position have different fields, the schema MUST use definterface + defrecord. Representing that variation with IPersistentMap, Object, a fixed-keys-schema of optional/nil fields, or a "justified deviation" is a FAIL. (A nullable field on instances that otherwise share the same shape is not this case — that is fine.) <yes/no – if no, FAIL>
- Inner collections that can exceed 100 elements subindexed? A collection needs subindexing if ANY instance can grow to have more than 100 elements (e.g., a popular entity). For each non-subindexed inner collection, name the specific code or protocol rule that enforces the size limit. If no enforcement mechanism exists, it is not bounded — subindex it. "Bounded by domain dynamics" or "typically small" without an enforcement mechanism does not count. <yes/no - if no, FAIL>

## Partitioning
For each write, state its partitioner and justify it (see `references/pstate-schema.md` "Partitioning control"). These indicators rule out some bad partitionings, not all:
- `|hash`: is the keyspace large (many keys per task → negligible hash variance) AND free of any key taking a disproportionate share of events or storage? <if the keyspace is sparse or any key can be hot, FAIL>
- `|all`: is the data small to hold on every task AND written rarely? <if large or high write throughput, FAIL>

Partitioning efficiency — check the `## Partitioning efficiency` table in `PLAN.md`:
- Is the table filled in for all three cluster sizes (N = 1, 16, 128)? <if any is missing, FAIL>
- Does it include every category of input as its own data-category row, including common/typical input, and do the frequency proportions in each table sum to 1? <if all inputs aren't represented or proportions don't sum to 1, FAIL — a single worst-case category is not a workload>
- Are the weighted sums Σ(proportion × seeks) and Σ(proportion × iterator-reads) computed for each N? <if not, FAIL>
- Is "seeks/op" the TOTAL across all tasks, not per-task? A read that fans to all N tasks MUST be counted as N seeks — every task it dispatches to counts, including ones whose local slice is empty (an empty/bloom-negative probe is still a dispatched read). <if any row counts per-task, divides by the task count, or drops empty probes — telltale signs: an `|all` read listed as 1 seek, or seeks/op that stays flat or FALLS as N grows — FAIL: it must be recounted as total-across-tasks>
- Recompute the weighted seeks yourself from the rows as TOTALS across all tasks. Do weighted seeks grow substantially from N = 1 to N = 128? <if yes, FAIL — unconditionally. Cost that grows with cluster size is anti-scalable: adding hardware makes each operation more expensive. No justification is accepted. The verdict is redesign.> Are the justifications drawn only from requirements stated in the spec? A justification based on the anticipated implementation of something outside the spec, or on improving a metric the spec does not state, is invalid — FAIL. Scan every justification for any assumption about the mechanisms of a part of the system this plan does not build — designing or assuming another part's mechanisms is invalid: FAIL.
- If there is doubt the chosen partitioning is optimal, or cases where it is known not to be: did the plan consider placement schemes that store state to assist partitioning, costed on TOTAL I/O (the placement state's own reads and writes included)? If such a scheme was rejected, was the rejection based on computed total cost? <if rejected on "complexity"/"bookkeeping" without cost arithmetic, FAIL>

## Topologies
- Microbatch unless justified? <yes/no>
- For each write operation that must be visible in single-digit milliseconds: is it handled by a stream topology? Microbatch has at least 300ms latency and cannot meet single-digit millisecond visibility requirements. <list each low-latency write and its topology — if any uses microbatch, FAIL>
- For each stream topology: list every processing concern it handles. For each concern, does it actually require stream semantics (millisecond-level update latency or ack coordination with the appender)? If any concern does not require stream, FAIL — that concern belongs in a separate microbatch topology. Multiple topologies can consume the same depot independently or topologies can communicate with an internal depot.
- Was any topology choice made, or any alternative rejected, on test-synchronization or observability grounds? <if yes, FAIL — any design can be synchronized by materializing progress state and polling it; re-evaluate the alternative on the spec's requirements alone>

## Production readiness
- Does the plan work correctly with multiple concurrent clients? <yes/no — if no, FAIL>
- Does the plan work correctly after a client process restarts? <yes/no — if no, FAIL>
- Does the plan work correctly if a worker process restarts at any point during a topology execution? <yes/no — if no, FAIL>
- Does the plan work at large scale (millions of entities, unbounded growth over time)? Are all collections that aren't enforced by the application to always be less than 100 elements subindexed? <yes/no — if no, FAIL>
- For each stream topology: list every non-idempotent write (appending to lists, incrementing counters, etc.). For each one, state its resolution — one of:
    - "Moved to microbatch topology: <topology-name>"
    - "Made idempotent by: <specific mechanism>"
    - "Deduplicated by: <specific mechanism>"
  If a non-idempotent write has no resolution, FAIL.
- For each stream topology that writes to multiple partitions: can a partial failure + retry leave any writes permanently unexecuted? <trace through failure at each partition hop — if yes, FAIL>

## Internal depot usage
- For each internal depot (`:disallow`): why can't the consuming topology just consume the original client-appended depot directly? An internal depot is only justified when:
  (a) the consuming topology must wait for the sending topology to complete first (ordering dependency), or
  (b) the internal depot carries data that is not available in any client-appended depot (e.g., computed/derived values)
- If neither condition applies, FAIL — remove the internal depot and have the second topology consume the same client-appended depot independently.

## Cross-topology correctness
- If data flows between topologies via internal depots: can the sending topology produce duplicate records (e.g., from stream retry)? If so, how does the receiving topology handle duplicates? <list each internal depot flow and dedup mechanism>

## Stream topology correctness
- For each `depot-partition-append!` in a stream topology: is there a `(|direct (ops/current-task-id))` immediately before it to force a commit boundary? If no, FAIL. Do NOT reason about whether the receiving topology "will read the data later" — ALWAYS add the commit boundary. See `references/stream.md` "When PState writes commit."

## In-memory state efficiency
- For each TaskGlobal or in-memory cache, does the plan use compact, flat data structures (primitive arrays) instead of object-heavy structures (TreeMap, HashMap, vectors of maps)?
- Object-heavy structures create per-entry heap overhead (object headers, pointers, boxed primitives) and produce large object graphs that increase GC pause times. On a latency-sensitive task thread, GC pauses cause latency spikes that propagate to all operations on that task — including unrelated reads and writes. The effect is non-local: one task's GC pause delays every client whose request routes to that task.
- For each TaskGlobal: FAIL if the data can be partially or fully stored in a compact, flat data structure.
- Does any TaskGlobal store data that could be fetched from a PState at query time without violating latency requirements, is not rebuildable from durable state, and is not something the spec tolerates losing? If so, FAIL.

## Minimality — adversarial simplification

Attack the plan as an over-engineering reviewer: actively search for a SIMPLER plan that keeps every required property — fewer depots, fewer topologies, fewer PStates, fewer mechanisms, less logic.

**Over-engineering is complexity beyond what the *optimal* design requires — not complexity beyond the first design that happens to work.** A mechanism is justified if the most efficient design meeting the spec needs it, even if a cruder, slower, or more wasteful design could omit it. Do NOT strip a mechanism merely because a worse design works without it — efficiency the spec demands is a required property, and a mechanism the optimal design needs to hit it is not over-engineering.

First, sketch in 2–4 sentences the simplest design you can construct that plausibly satisfies the spec. Diff the plan against the sketch: every mechanism in the plan that is absent from the sketch must justify itself below.

For EVERY mechanism in the plan — each depot, topology, query topology, PState, TaskGlobal, and each nontrivial protocol (handoff, flag, counter, cursor, gate) — fill in a block:

### <mechanism name>
- **Delete it**: what specifically breaks? Name the required property lost, with a verbatim spec/IMPLICIT_SPEC citation. If nothing breaks, or the only thing lost is a property the spec does not require, FAIL — remove it from the plan.
- **Merge or bypass it**: can it be folded into an existing mechanism, or replaced by doing the work directly where it's triggered? If yes with no required property lost, FAIL — simplify the plan.

Rules:
- A property the spec does not demand (e.g. exactness beyond stated guarantees) does NOT justify a mechanism.
- "It is legal/documented" is not a justification — legality is necessary, not sufficient.
- Indirection is itself a mechanism: if component A could do X directly but instead signals component B to do X, the signaling channel must justify itself.
- **No dismissal without construction.** You may not reject an alternative — as "over-engineering," "costlier elsewhere," "immaterial," or "the spec mandates this cost" — until you have CONSTRUCTED it concretely and shown the tradeoff with numbers. A rejection requires a built alternative and a side-by-side cost comparison, not an assertion.

## Throughput — adversarial

Attack the plan as a throughput reviewer: actively search for a design that sustains higher throughput — lower aggregate resource usage (seeks/iterations summed across all tasks, weighted by each operation's call rate) — while still meeting every latency requirement.

For each frequent operation, sketch the lowest-aggregate-cost design you can construct that still meets its latency target, then diff it against the plan. If the sketch does less total work per operation while staying within latency, FAIL — adopt the cheaper design.

Look for ways to reduce RocksDB seeks or replace seeks with cheaper iterator reads.

Rules:
- Parallelizing across more tasks lowers latency, not aggregate cost — spreading the same work wider is not a throughput improvement.
- Meeting the latency target is necessary, not sufficient: among designs that meet it, the one with the lowest aggregate cost wins.
- **No dismissal without construction.** You may not reject a lower-cost design because it costs more *elsewhere* (more writes, more storage, more mechanism) until you have CONSTRUCTED it and quantified both sides. "It would add writes / be more complex / the spec mandates this cost" is not a rejection — build the alternative, put the numbers side by side, then decide.

## Spec coverage — trace every operation and constraint

Enumerate every operation in the protocol/spec AND every constraint, prohibition, invariant, and edge case from the spec and `IMPLICIT_SPEC.md`. For each one, fill in a block below. Do NOT collapse multiple items into one block. Do NOT replace any block with a single-bullet "covered" claim — that bypasses the check.

For each operation and each constraint:

### <operation name or constraint label>
- **Source** (verbatim quote from spec / IMPLICIT_SPEC.md): "..."
- **Trace through the plan**: walk the plan's mechanism end-to-end on a concrete scenario. Use real numbers (entity counts, sizes, timings) — not "a user does X." Show what the plan produces at each step.
- **Fault-tolerance check** — for each of these, state what happens and whether the constraint still holds:
  - In-memory state on the affected task is cleared (worker restart): what is the state of this operation/constraint immediately after, and how does the plan recover it?
  - A topology is retried: does re-executing the event produce the same result, or does it double-count / duplicate / corrupt?
  - A multi-partition write fails partway: can the system end up in an inconsistent state where some partitions reflect the write and others don't?
- **Race-condition check** — for each of these, state whether the plan handles it:
  - Two concurrent clients writing the same entity at the same time
  - Events arriving out of order at a partition due to partitioner hops
- **Flaws found**: list every way the trace, fault-tolerance, or race analysis shows the plan failing to satisfy the source. If none, write "none found, with reasoning: <reasoning>".
- **Verdict**: PASS | FAIL
- **If FAIL**: the specific plan change required.

### Anti-patterns that must FAIL this section

- Skipping the fault-tolerance check because "the spec doesn't mention it." Worker restart and retry are always in scope; the plan must hold under them.
- Skipping the race-condition check because "tests are single-threaded." Production has concurrent clients; the plan must hold under them.
