not thought out ideas, might seem like rambling, use loose terms which might be totally different from what they mean in

I only write to get thoughts of my head, and connect with people who find this worth engaging :)

We have Google earth to explore any part of the world, but we don't have anything like that for knowledge. 

What is the current state of progress on autoimmune diseases, what and how well do the experts understand it? who is working on it? 
how far have they got? what are all the explored directions? how can I understand, contribute, use and spread it? 

We need a place to get the best view for the current state of things, and contribute our part.

How can I start from 60k feet view and get to 30k? Maybe read a book, listen to some lectures, podcast etc. I have tried
they don't work, it feels like its working but for me, I have realised over time its more of insight porn than anything else.

There is no REPL, no visual model I can break, play, or engage with. For 60k feet view of biology in 2024 I would expect a 3d interactive
model of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). 

Time travel should be possible in 2024, atleast for recorded knowledge. I should be able to ask how we got here?
We need a massive interactive "God created the integers" for all knowledge. I should be able to start 2-3000 years back
and rediscover for myself. 

Define knowledge. 

A scientific paper should not only be a paper with text written on it and the reader develops the model in their brain. 
We should be able to upload a paper and see what is the diff from the current model, we should be able to replicate it 
via a simulation. Maybe as I go through section by section and the 3d model is updating itself. 

The paper should not be a paper in current format imo, it should be a log, sometimes I am more interested in knowing how
than what, I want to feel what the author felt, I want to do the work. So when I am reading the log I am building the world
piece by piece, maybe I want to stop at some point and then think by myself, I want to re discover it and not know it. 

Science should be distributed, open and accessible for all the humans. University is not. 
State of what we call "collaboration" in physical world is not what I mean by collaboration. The "collaborative" tools
in the software space just mean here are cursors of all the people. CRDT is the cutting edge topic in collaborative software
which I think is the first layer of abstraction over "here are cursors of all the people". Conflicts in a collaborative 
software are considered to be bad, yes they are by current definition at the current level of abstraction. If the abstraction
layer is higher conflicts are good for progress.
